Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as we've seen, we can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that we can either use them directly, or, we can use the features that they have learned and apply them to our scenario. This is Transfer learning, and we'll look into that this week!
