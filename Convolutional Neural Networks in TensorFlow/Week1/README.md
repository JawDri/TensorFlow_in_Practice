In the first course in this specialization, we had an introduction to TensorFlow, and how, with its high level APIs we could do basic image classification, an we learned a little bit about Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this course we'll go deeper into using ConvNets will real-world data, and learn about techniques that we can use to improve your ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification! In Week 1, this week, we'll get started by looking at a much larger dataset than we've been using thus far: The Cats and Dogs dataset which had been a Kaggle Challenge in image classification!
