Taking everything that we've learned in training a neural network based on NLP, we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction. Given a body of words, we could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once we've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week we'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!
